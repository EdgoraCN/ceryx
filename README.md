# Ceryx - Simple, but powerful Reverse Proxy

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/sourcelair/ceryx.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/sourcelair/ceryx)

Ceryx is a dynamic reverse proxy based on NGINX OpenResty with an API.

Ceryx is used to provide public URLs to tens of thousands of projects at https://www.sourcelair.com.

## Proxy
Ceryx is using NGINX OpenResty under the hood, in order to route requests
based on the request host. The routing is made using the NGINX Lua module,
which is querying a Redis backend for results.

## API
Ceryx comes with a simple Flask web service, which supports REST operations on
routes. You can dynamically create, update, and delete routes on the go using
a REST client.

## Configuration
Ceryx supports configuration using environment variables. The supported
configuration options are the following:

  * ``CERYX_NAME``: sets the API service name - defaults to ceryx
  * ``CERYX_DEBUG``: enables debuging on the API service - defaults to true
  * ``CERYX_API_HOST``: sets the host that the API will bind to - defaults to 127.0.0.1
  * ``CERYX_API_PORT``: sets the port that the API will listen - defaults to 5555
  * ``CERYX_SERVER_NAME``: the URL of the API service - default to None
  * ``CERYX_API_HOSTNAME``: identical to `CERYX_SERVER_NAME`, but without imposing `Host` header limits - default to None
  * ``CERYX_SECRET_KEY``: the path of the secret key to use - defaults to None
  * ``CERYX_REDIS_HOST``: the redis host to connect to - defaults to 127.0.0.1
  * ``CERYX_REDIS_PORT``: the redis port to connect to - defaults to 6379
  * ``CERYX_REDIS_PREFIX``: the redis prefix to use in keys - defaults to ceryx

## Quick Bootstrap
Ceryx loves Docker, so you can easily bootstrap Ceryx using the following
command, given that you have already installed Docker and Docker Compose.

```
docker-compose up
```

To access (and therefore üê∂ dogfood üê∂) the Ceryx API via Ceryx' proxy, set the
`asd` environment variable and run the following command in your terminal:

```
docker-compose exec api bin/populate-api
```

## Development

Ceryx was developed as a private project for SourceLair PC. Initial development
had different stages, having tproxy, Twisted and plain NGINX as a proxy server
and backends ranging from MongoDB to etcd.

After a lot of experimentation, we have ended up in this solution and we'll
keep developing this as an Open Source project. Feel free to make suggestions
in the [issues section](https://github.com/sourcelair/ceryx/issues) in Github
or open o pull request.
